# Clinic Management System

The **Clinic Management System** is an internal software solution developed by **Renuka Pharma** to enhance clinic operations, manage patient appointments, and maintain records efficiently. This system provides clinics with a streamlined approach to administrative tasks while helping doctors focus on patient care. 

As part of our value-added services, this system is offered to doctors who purchase our medicines, improving their experience with features like prescription tracking and feedback. Additionally, it provides Renuka Pharma with insights into which medicines are being prescribed and requested, allowing for better inventory management and customer service.

## Key Features

- **Patient Management**: Maintain detailed patient records, visit history, and treatment plans.
- **Appointment Scheduling**: Easily manage doctor schedules, appointments, and cancellations.
- **Prescription Tracking**: Track which medicines are being prescribed and requested by patients.
- **Feedback Integration**: Doctors can provide feedback on prescribed medicines, helping Renuka Pharma optimize its offerings.
- **Multi-Clinic Support**: Manage multiple clinic locations under a single platform.
- **Analytics & Reporting**: Access detailed reports on clinic performance, patient demographics, and more.

## Next Iteration

In future versions, the system will include advanced features to track the most frequently prescribed medicines and provide insights to help both clinics and Renuka Pharma optimize their processes.
